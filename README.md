Obtained the USGS earthquake dataset from the USGS GeoJSON Feed page (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php).
Used the URL (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson) of the JSON representation to pull in the data for visualization.
Created a map using Leaflet to plot all earthquakes based on longitude and latitude.
Data markers reflected earthquake magnitude by size and depth by color.
Included popups to provide additional information when markers were clicked.
Created a legend to provide context for the map data.
